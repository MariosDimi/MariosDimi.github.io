From a young age I was into computers and electronic devices. Working on computers was my favorite, I was always on the web, listening to music, playing games, and most of the time I was asking my dad questions on how everything works. Few years go by and every day I was learning new stuff about computers. Little did I knew that whatever I see on the screen, alot of stuff happens behind it. Besides the knowledge I had from my dad and from the books he had, I had no problem having a computer class in school in Greece. Although the books were in English, I was translating the words in my head before saying anything in Greek. As days go by my interest for computers grew more and it came to a point that everybody was coming to me with questions and issues so I can help them and fix their computers, even from far away from me (thats when I learned how to fix problems remotly). I decided to go for it and since I like computers and how the programs work, I wanted to pursuit that field of study and become better at this. At first I was going for Computer Science to have litte bit of everything, but until I realize that CS has to work on based of Software Engineering so I decided to pursue SE instead. 

Hopefuly through Flatiron School, I will succeed at Software Engineering and have a greater opportunity to land a great computer company job.
