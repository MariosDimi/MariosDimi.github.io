Finally to the first project in Ruby. The project is similar to our labs we've been doing all this time the only difference is the difficulty and the effort you give to this project. There will always be times that the coding will be eays and then right instantly it goes to very difficult. In this case, the project is where it has alot of this mixup of easy and difficult. This project contains coding as usual in ruby and also scrapping from a website. Scrapping from a website is the most important thing in this project because its where this project test your knowlede on how you can get information from a webside right into your code. 

What scrapping is, its when you run a specific command on your code it will give you a specific information from that website, for example when theres a code that has to do with movies that are playing right now that scrapping has some information stored in. So when the user wants to see what movies are there out now, the code will tell the user those two or three movies are currently playing. Then the user will want to know more information about those movies he can choose 1, 2 ,3 and so on then scrapping comes in play. When the user types 1 he will get information about the movie on the number 1 option based on the website the code scraped from, 2 will be the same and so on. 

Scrapping is basically the information the code gets from a specific website and in that case you dont need to copy the actual information and paste it into your code. And thats what the project is about, your code will run based on the scrapping you do from a website, but if you dont do scrapping correctly the code will not work correctly as it should on this project and it will be an obvious reason that you might had pasted the information to it.
