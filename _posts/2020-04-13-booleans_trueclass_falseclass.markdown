Boolean in Ruby is a way to get a true or false statement in our code. Whether that result is true, that instace is called TrueClass and when the result is false its called FalseClass. 
There are three main boolean operators that we use in Ruby and those are:
1. (!) "single-bang" that represents "NOT"
2. (&&) "double-ampersant" that represents "AND"
3. (||) "double-pipe" that represents "OR"
Starting with the single-bang (!) when we have a condition that is true then the (!) will make it false and then the opposite, the false condition will become true.
The (&&) needs to be evaluated to true on both sides of &&.
The (||) to get evaluated to true one of the sides has to be true between the || "OR".

Booleans in Ruby has a special part in coding because in that way the user when he/she types an information on that code he will get the results he/she wants or not depending on the true/false statement.
